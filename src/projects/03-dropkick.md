These initial mockups are used to gauge whether or not the overall design is heading in the right direction, or if we need to reverse course and go back to new mood boards and style tiles."

Dropkick clothing is a storefront concept targeting young adults, age 18-29, who are looking for one-of-a-kind vintage and upcycled clothing. The collections are organized into curated, thematic drops for the easy purchase of multiple pieces. Customers may also browse by clothing type to buy one-off items from any collection.

Dropkick needed to have both a professional look but also grunge aesthetic appeal. To explore how this combination would work, mood boarding was done before the design phase started.

This project is still in progress.
