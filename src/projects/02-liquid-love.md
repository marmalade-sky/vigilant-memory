description: "A beer review and catalog site! Not only is fun to browse but is super-easy to update. One review cascades into appropriate beer groups by leveraging the robust collections feature of Eleventy."
quote: "I've always wanted to create a beer review site, but I knew that it had to be so much more than a blog with a list of posts. I wanted reviews to be smartly tagged, grouped, filtered, and presented in ways that help visitors explore Chicago-brewed beer based on brew style."

    text: "After empathetically understanding the challenges and defining what I envisioned this portfolio to be if I couldn't include NDA-protected work, I began the ideation phase. This included UX/UI portfolio research, rough wireframe sketches, and copy drafting. Afterwards, I began prototyping design concepts in Adobe XD and getting feedback from designers in my network on which designs they preferred and why."

Built as a Jamstack site, this portfolio delivers dynamic content with a pre-built front end and leverages the static site generator Eleventy, the Tailwind CSS utility library, Netlify, and the Dribbble API."

I like beer. This is probably one of the first things you will learn about me, and in my humble opinion, Chicago is home to some of the best breweries in the country. It only made sense to create a site that will record and catalog all the beers I enjoy.

I needed a site that could take one file and serve it in a number of ways: a full page review, an item in a beer style collection, and in areas that highlight only my top go-to brews. Satatic site generators to the rescue! If you have time, take a peek and <a href="https://improved-broccoli.netlify.app/" class="text-pink-500 hover:underline hover:underline-offset-4" target="_blank">see if our beer tastes match</a>.
