description: "A beer review and catalog site! Not only is fun to browse but is super-easy to update. One review cascades into appropriate beer groups by leveraging the robust collections feature of Eleventy."
quote: "I've always wanted to create a beer review site, but I knew that it had to be so much more than a blog with a list of posts. I wanted reviews to be smartly tagged, grouped, filtered, and presented in ways that help visitors explore Chicago-area beer based on brew style."

I like beer. This is probably one of the first things you will learn about me, and in my humble opinion, Chicago is home to some of the best breweries in the country. It only made sense to create a place that will record and catalog all the beers I enjoy.

I needed a site that could take one file and serve it in a number of ways: a full page review, an item in a beer style collection, and in areas that highlight my top go-to brews. Static site generators to the rescue! If you have time, take a peek and <a href="https://liquid-love.netlify.app/" class="text-pink-500 hover:underline hover:underline-offset-4" target="_blank">see if our beer tastes match</a>.
