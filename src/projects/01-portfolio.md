description: "A fun, breezy, bespoke portfolio site created using Design Thinking principles, custom illustration and iconography, and built with Jamstack architecture to deliver a joyful, lightweight experience."
quote: "I wanted a fun, breezy, beautiful site that was lightweight and easy to maintain. It reflects who I am as a person and in the work that I do. Reaching out and connecting with the creative spark in others is special. It's something that generic social hubs cannot provide. There is so much power and satisfaction in online exploration. There's power in finding and consuming the content you want, rather than blindly relying on what is served to you via often exploitative algorithms. "

    text: "Journaling helps bring designs to life. For me, this is the beginning of the ideation phase. Here I begin UX/UI portfolio research, rough wireframe sketches, and copy drafting. Afterwards, I start prototyping design concepts in Adobe XD and solicit feedback from designers in my network on which designs they preferred and why."

    text: "After testing an initial designs that included superfulous content that wasn't well received (turns out no one really cares about the books I'm reading), I go back and create two additional designs that focus more on the work I'm doing and the art I'm creating rather than the content I'm consuming."

Every vector-based icon and illustration is hand-crafted in Adobe Illustrator and scales beautifully on any size device."

    text: "It's important that this site is lightweight, easy to maintain, and without friction in its use. That means taking just as much care with the code as I do the visual design. Built as a Jamstack site, this portfolio delivers dynamic content with a pre-built front end and leverages the static site generator Eleventy, the Tailwind CSS utility library, Netlify, and the Dribbble API."

In an oversaturated market of UX/UI designers, my goal is to create a memorable, bespoke portfolio site for independent passion projects, since I am unable to publicly share past professional work with NDA-protections. 

I take this as a challenge to showcase the boundless potential in what I can do creatively for myself and in collaboration with friends, fellow designers, and my community. It is my passion to make the apps we use and the sites visit simple, engaging, and enjoyable.
