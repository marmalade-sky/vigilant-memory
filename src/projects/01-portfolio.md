description: "A fun, breezy, bespoke portfolio site created using Design Thinking principles, custom illustration and iconography, and built with Jamstack architecture to deliver a joyful, lightweight experience."
quote: "I wanted a fun, breezy, beautful site that was lightweight and easy to maintain. It reflects who I am as a person and in the work that I do. Reaching out and connecting with the innate creativity in others is special. It's something that generic social hubs cannot provide. There is so much power and satisfaction online exploration. There is power in finding and consuming the content you want, rather than blindly relying on what is served to you via an often exploitative algorithm."

    title: Built on Design Thinking principles,
    text: "After empathetically understanding the challenges and defining what I envisioned this portfolio to be if I couldn't include NDA-protected work, I began the ideation phase. This included UX/UI portfolio research, rough wireframe sketches, and copy drafting. Afterwards, I began prototyping design concepts in Adobe XD and getting feedback from designers in my network on which designs they preferred and why."

    title: Prototyping designs,
    text: "After testing an initial design that included superfulous content that wasn't well received (turns out no one really cares about the books I'm reading), I went back and created two additional designs that focused more on the work I was doing and the art I was creating rather than the content I was consuming."

    title: Custom iconography & illustration,
    text: "Inviting, playful, and friendly imagery in a carefully chosen color palette is central to this site. It brings humanity and warmth to the ones and zeros of digital art. Every vector-based icon and illustration was hand-crafted in illustrator and scales beautifully on any size device."

    title: A lightweight Jamstack site,
    text: "It's important that this site is lightweight, easy to maintain, and without friction in its use. That means taking just as much care with the code as I do the visual design. Built as a Jamstack site, this portfolio delivers dynamic content with a pre-built front end and leverages the static site generator Eleventy, the Tailwind CSS utility library, Netlify, and the Dribbble API."

In an oversaturated market of UX/UI designers, my goal is to create a charming and memorable bespoke portfolio site for independent passion projects since I am unable to publicly share past professional work with NDA-protections. 

I take this as a challenge to showcase the boundless potential in what I can do creatively for myself and in collaboration with friends, fellow designers, and my community. It is my passion to make the apps we use and the sites visit simple, engaging, and enjoyable.
